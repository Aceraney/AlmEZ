CHANGES RELATIVE TO RELEASE
  https://github.com/LincolnUniLTL/AlmEZ/tree/73c3ad7749965fee15382a13dd475b7d41ef6bf1

- Authenticate via Alma REST API (instead of SOAP API).
- Use PECL HTTP v2 (instead of v1).
- Allow apikey to appear in either HTTP query string or HTTP header.
- Only allow User-Agent header to be used for HTTP GET (as it appears to break the 'Authenticate
  user' POST operation).
- Allow URL template substitutions to also be made in query string values.
- URL encode query string values (eg. required if password contains special characters).
- Cache user detail response (so we can use it multiple times without a new API call for each).
- Optionally verify IP address of caller (should be the EZproxy IP address).
- Optionally perform logging (via a thread-safe logger).
- Created new class AuthenticateEZproxyResponse:
  * Moved several non-class methods into it.
  * Method authenticateEZproxy() was moved into this class with new method name doTraditionalAuth().
  * Added alternative method doCustomAuth() which checks additional user details before providing
    authentication to EZproxy (eg. that identifier is a barcode; or group and statistic_category match
    some criteria). This is mostly driven by an array of rules.
